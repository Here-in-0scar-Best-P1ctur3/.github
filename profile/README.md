On Friday, TriStar Pictures released Here, a $50 million Robert Zemeckis-directed film that used real time generative AI face transformation techniques to portray actors Tom Hanks and Robin Wright across a 60-year span, marking one of Hollywood's first full-length features built around AI-powered visual effects.

Tom Hanks is one of the most reliable A-listers in the industry today. The Forrest Gump star's films have grossed nearly $10 billion at the worldwide box office. There was a time when hooking Tom Hanks' name to a project could almost guarantee success. But as times and viewing habits have changed, so have the box office returns for tentpole flicks.

Robert Zemeckis’ best films were box office hits that helped put the American filmmaker’s name on the map like Forrest Gump, the Back to the Future films, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. With his top box office flick being 1994’s best picture winner Forrest Gump, it would naturally make sense for the team behind the comedy-drama to have brought in the same numbers with their new drama Here. As the Tom Hanks/Robin Wright-led film flopped at the box office, Zemeckis gets candid about his frustration with the film industry as a whole.

Robert Zemeckis’ Here isn’t a movie. It’s a carousel. From his fixed point of view, the film travels around and around and back home again. Here is an ambitious project filled with technical innovation and formal know-how that, like Megalopolis, has a reach that extends beyond its grasp. The director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Forrest Gump, and The Polar Express does not fear the Uncanny Valley. He lives in it, finding inspiration in the digital makeup effects that transform Tom Hanks into his Bosom Buddies former self. This isn’t the first time viewers have been horrified by Hanks’ dead-eyed CG visage, but it’s the first time we’ve seen him from this vantage. 

The film begins in prehistoric times, the story’s all-important spot in the future United States seeing large insects and giant dinosaurs. Then come meteors, ice, plant life, indigenous people and, eventually, Colonial types, who dig a foundation for a modest house, lay bricks and begin to raise walls.

“Here “faced a tough reception both at the box office and with critics. It opened in fifth place, grossing just $5 million from nearly 2,700 theaters, well below its $45 million production budget. The film also earned a tepid 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a “B-” grade on CinemaScore.

The best streaming services, including Hulu, come with deep content libraries. While that's great, because we get endless hours of TV shows and movies, it can be a bit of a struggle to figure out what to watch. Luckily, Hulu has a top 15 shows and movies collection that gives you a look at what’s trending on the platform.

A background role is any non-speaking role in a film, television show, or commercial. Some roles are featured, special ability, core (they come back for the same role for several days in the same production), and sometimes are part of large crowds.

So where can you Watch Here? Is it on HBO Max? What about 𝙽etflix? Here’s how to Watch the Here epic starring 2024 Latest English and Hindi Sub Mo𝚟ies.
You know those extended commercials that sometimes run around the holidays that offer up vague, sentimentalized bromides about love, family, and brotherhood that are brought to you by soulless corporations as part of their annual year-end "We're good, right?" campaigns? Imagine one of those stretched out to 104 minutes, and you have Robert Zemeckis' "Here," a hollow and vapid paean to the whole of the human experience that has all the depth and profundity of a generic greeting card. The result is a movie that isn't just bad but baffling—one that traffics in practically every imaginable emotion without generating a genuine one of its own. 

Adapted from a conceptual graphic novel by Richard McGuire where the perspective is the same on every page — the living room of a century-old American house — while rectangle-shaped panels within each frame reveal actions from different years, if not entirely separate epochs, “Here” is about an idea.

Robert Zemeckis has always been about a great technological or storytelling conceit in his movies whether it’s the live-action animated hybrid of the 3x Oscar winning Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, the insertion of Tom Hanks in famed historical footage in Oscar Best Picture Forrest Gump or the motion capture of The Polar Express.

Life isn’t too short — it’s long, as Robert Zemeckis’ brisk, inventive, and earnest latest experiment, “Here,” ponders in an hour and 40 minutes that span multiple centuries and lifetimes unfolding on the same spot on Earth. The Oscar-winning, ever-envelope-pushing filmmaker opens on prehistoric times as dinosaurs stalk the Earth, charts the arrival of Indigenous people in that very spot, gives us the birth of Benjamin Franklin, his kid, and his kid’s kid, and then takes us through the life and times of a midcentury American family led by a de-aged Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. It’s a “Forrest Gump” reunion for Zemeckis in more ways than one, as his Forrest and Jenny, here Richard and Margaret Young, are joined by that film’s Oscar-winning scribe, Eric Roth, in adapting Richard McGuire’s celebrated graphic novel.

When Is Here Release Date?

Yes, Here will be released exclusively in theaters on June 28, 2024. Originally, the Mo𝚟ie was expected to be released on June 28, 2024, but was then pushed to November 4, 2024, and again to June 28, 2024, with these delays ultimately being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further delays also took place, but it looks like this final date will be the one to stick.

Hanks and Wright play a married couple who are seen at many ages and life stages in the film, thanks to Zemeckis’ deft use of bleeding edge techniques including an AI-assisted aging and de-aging process to convey a lifetime. That meant paying meticulous attention to the specificity of a person’s body movements at a given age. To cite but one example, how one bounces off a couch as a nimble teenager is very different from how that same person gets up from a couch as a 60-something. 

It’s a struggle to watch actors I know are good starring in a film that clearly isn’t. Such is the case with Robert Zemeckis’ Here. It’s an hour and 45 minutes of Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Paul Bettany and more acting in a way that can’t be taken seriously and almost feels pretend. The de-aging is jarring and noticeable, especially when we have to hear Hanks’ 68-year-old voice come out of what’s supposed to be an 18-year-old’s mouth, and the film is poorly lit. It’s a film so soulless I questioned the point of it.

The marketing of the film Here has heavily emphasized its status as a Forrest Gump reunion for Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and director Robert Zemeckis. (The script is also from Gump screenwriters Zemeckis and Eric Roth.) Whether or not a Forrest Gump reunion was something people were looking for 30 years after the fact, Here does have a lot in common with its predecessor, including the sense that it's sometimes more tricky — both technically and narratively — than good.

When it comes to films that will cause an emotional gut punch, director Robert Zemeckis has his share. But while his new film Here certainly attempts to harken back to some of his previous work, most notably Forrest Gump, it is ultimately a cheap imitation of what made that film a classic.

Also, the tone’s off, which is a directorial matter. McGuire’s graphic novel is a transporting wonder of dry wit and plaintive reflection, free from thesis statements beyond Ben Franklin’s observation (so McGuire imagines) that “life has a flair for rhyming events.” The movie lunges for your tear ducts and your heartstrings; the narrative hopscotch won’t cooperate and it’s not really what McGuire had in mind. At all.

Somehow, a handful of simple interactions between the older versions of Hanks and Wright cut through all that. Now and then a line comes along that sticks, quietly, as when Richard realizes he has lived, George Bailey “It’s a Wonderful Life”-style, preoccupied with money and worrying about “every damn thing.” And the ending, however shameless, works. But the book’s melancholy spareness has been replaced by a “Here” existing somewhere in a pristine, remote suburb we’ll call Uncanny Valley Falls, a few miles away from real life.
